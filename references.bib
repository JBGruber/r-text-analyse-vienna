	abstract = {Politics and political conflict often occur in the written and spoken word. Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods—they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

	abstract = {"The book provides a technical perspective on the most contemporary data-driven approaches, focusing on techniques from supervised and unsupervised machine learning. It also includes background in the salient linguistic issues, as well as computational representations and algorithms. The first section of the book explores what can be with individual words. The second section concerns structured representations such as sequences, trees, and graphs. The third section highlights different approaches to the representation and analysis of linguistic meaning. The final section describes three of the most transformative applications of natural language processing: information extraction, machine translation, and text generation. The book describes the technical foundations of the field, including the most relevant machine learning techniques, algorithms, and linguistic representations. From these foundations, it extends to contemporary research in areas such as deep learning. Each chapter contains exercises that include paper-and-pencil analysis of the computational algorithms and linguistic issues, as well as software implementations"--},
